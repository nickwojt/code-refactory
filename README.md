# Code-Refactory

In this project I used VsCode to modify pre-exisiting index.html and style.css files. I changed all HTML elements to semantic elements in the correct order where necessary. I also updated the CSS to include the semantic selectors so the webpage would be restored to working order. The last step was to merge this local repository into this GitHub repository.
